# dat250-spring-counter-todos

The test suite (**TodoControllerTest**) should run after your implementation. You are not allowed to change the test class!

**Careful:** the test class sends POST-Request to create TODOs without ids and expects the single created TODO returned with an id!

[![TodoControllerTest](../../actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/main.yml)

Check the tab **Actions** in GitHub for more information or to initially activate the workflow run.
